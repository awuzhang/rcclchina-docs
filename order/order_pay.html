Unless negligent, Carrier is neither responsible nor liable for any loss of or damage to Passenger's property, whether contained in luggage or otherwise.  Liability for loss of or damage to Passenger's property in connection with any air or ground transportation shall be the sole responsibility of the provider of the service and in accordance with applicable limitations. <br>
			行李损失或损毁的责任. 无论行李是否打包装箱，承运人均无需对乘客行李的任何损失或损毁负责，除非承运人对该损失或损毁负有过失责任。对于在任何航空运输或陆上运输过程中乘客财产所产生的损失或损毁，其责任均应由该等运输服务的提供商单独承担，并适用相关责任限制之规定。 <br>

			</p>

			<p>4. MEDICAL CARE AND OTHER PERSONAL SERVICES <br> 医疗护理和其它个人服务 <br>
			a. Availability of Medical Care.	Due to the nature of travel by sea and the ports visited, the availability of medical care onboard the Vessel and in ports of call may be limited or delayed and medical evacuation may not be possible from the Vessel while at sea or from every location to which the Vessel sails. <br>
			可提供的医疗护理服务. 基于海上旅行的性质以及所访问的港口的限制，游轮上及所停靠港口能够提供的医疗护理服务可能会有限制或迟延；此外，承运人可能无法在游轮海上航行期间或在游轮航行过程中停靠的所有港口，为乘客提供紧急运送就医服务。 <br>
			b. Relationship with Service Providers. To the extent Passengers retain the services of medical personnel or independent contractors on or off the Vessel, Passengers do so at their sole risk. Any medical personnel attending to a Passenger on or off the Vessel, if arranged by Carrier, are provided solely for the convenience of the Passenger, work directly for the Passenger, and shall not be deemed to be acting under the control or supervision of the Carrier, as Carrier is not a medical provider. Likewise, any onboard concessions (including but not limited to the gift shops, spas, beauty salon, art program, photography, formalwear concessions) are either operated by or are independent contractors on board the Vessel, on Transport or elsewhere and are provided solely for the convenience of Passenger. Even though the Carrier shall be entitled to charge a fee and earn a profit for arranging such services, all such persons or entities shall be deemed independent contractors and not acting as agents or representatives of Carrier. Carrier assumes no liability whatsoever for any treatment, failure to treat, diagnosis, misdiagnosis, actual or alleged malpractice, advice, examination or other services provided by such persons or entities. Guest acknowledges that the Vessel's hair dresser, manicurist, art auctioneer, gift shop personnel, spa personnel, wedding planners and other providers of merchandise and personal services are employees of independent contractors and that Carrier is not responsible for their actions. <br>
			与服务提供商之间的关系. 若乘客在船上或船下接受任何医护人员或独立合同方提供的医护服务，则所产生的一切风险均应由该乘客自行承担。承运人在船上或船下为本船乘客所安排的任何医护人员，均仅是为了便利乘客之目的而提供的，该等医护人员直接为乘客提供服务，不应被视为是在承运人的控制或监管下提供服务，因为承运人并非医疗服务提供商。同样的，本游轮、交通工具或其它地方的任何特许服务项目（包括但不限于礼品店、Spas、美容沙龙、艺术品展、摄影服务或正装特许经营店），均是独立合同方或由独立合同方承包商自行运营，提供该等服务仅是为乘客便利之目的。尽管承运人有权就上述服务的安排收取费用并获取收益，但上述所有人员或实体应被视为是独立合同方，而并非是作为承运人的代理人或代表行事。对于该等人员或实体所提供的任何医护服务、疏于提供医护服务、诊断、误诊、实际或被指控的治疗失当、建议、检查或其它服务，承运人均无需承担任何责任。乘客确认：本游轮上的美发化妆师、美甲师、艺术品拍卖人、礼品店工作人员、Spa工作人员、婚礼规划师及提供其它商品和个人服务的提供者均为独立合同方的员工，承运人无需对上述人员的任何行为承担任何责任。 <br>
			c. Payment for Medical or Personal Care Services. Passenger shall pay for all medical care or other personal services requested or required, whether onboard or ashore, including the cost of any emergency medical care or transportation incurred by Carrier and any costs associated with the provision of medical services as provided in the CLIA Passenger Bill of Rights.  If Passenger is unable to pay and the Carrier pays for such expenses, then Passenger shall reimburse Carrier for those expenses. <br>
			医护服务或个人护理服务的付款. 乘客应就其在船上或船下所要求或申请的任何医护服务或其它个人服务支付所有服务费用，上述服务费用包括由承运人垫付的任何紧急医疗护理费或交通费，以及为提供邮轮协会乘客权利法案规定的医疗服务而产生的任何费用。在乘客无力支付上述服务费且承运人代其支付了该服务费后，乘客应就该代付费用向承运人进行偿还。
			</p>
			<p>5. SHORE EXCURSIONS, TOURS, FACILITIES OR OTHER TRANSPORTATION <br> 岸上短途观光、观光游、设施或其它交通 <br>
			All arrangements made for or by Passenger for transportation (other than on the Vessel) before, during or after the Cruise or CruiseTour of any kind whatsoever, as well as air arrangements, shore excursions, tours, hotels, restaurants, attractions and other similar activities or services, including all related conveyances, products or facilities, are made solely for Passenger's convenience and are at Passenger's risk. The providers, owners and Carriers of such services, conveyances, products and facilities are independent contractors and are not acting as Representatives or representatives of Carrier. Even though Carrier may collect a fee for, or otherwise profit from, making such arrangements and offers for sale shore excursions, tours, hotels, restaurants, attractions, the Land Tour and other similar activities or services taking place off the Vessel for a profit, it does not undertake to supervise or control such independent contractors or their employees, nor maintain their conveyances or facilities, and makes no representation, whether express or implied, regarding their suitability or safety.  In no event shall Carrier be liable for any loss, delay, disappointment, damage, injury, death or other harm whatsoever to Passenger which occurs on or off the Vessel or the Transport as a result of any acts, omissions or negligence of any independent contractors.  For the avoidance of doubt, any shore excursion or other services Passenger may purchase from a Travel Representative should be subject to terms and conditions agreed between Travel Representative and Passenger, and Carrier assumes no liability for any loss, delay, disappointment, damage, injury, death or other harm whatsoever to Passenger which occurs during shore excursion or performance of such other services. <br>
			由承运人为乘客安排的或乘客自行安排的在游轮巡游/游轮观光活动之前、之中或之后的任何交通服务（本游轮上的航行除外），以及任何的航空运输服务、岸上短途观光、观光游、酒店、餐馆、游览项目及其它类似活动或服务（包括所有相关的运输、产品或设施），均应视为是专为乘客的便利而提供的，且由乘客自行承担风险。上述服务、运输、产品和设施的提供商、所有人和承运人均为独立合同方，而并非作为承运人的代理人或代表行事。尽管承运人就其安排或提供以供乘客购买的岸上短途观光、观光游、酒店、餐馆、游览项目、陆地游项目及其他类似的在船下提供的盈利活动或服务，可能会收取费用或从中盈利，但承运人无义务对上述独立合同方或其员工的行为进行监督或控制，无义务提供运输工具或设施，也不就上述活动或服务的适当性或安全性做出任何明示或默示的声明。在任何情况下，若因上述任何独立合同方的任何行为、过失或过错之原因，而使乘客在船上、船下或上述交通工具上遭受了任何损失、延误、不满、损害、人身伤害、死亡或其它任何伤害，承运人均不应对此承担任何责任。为免疑惑，乘客从旅行代表处所购买的岸上短途观光或其他服务，应由其与该旅行代表所同意的条件和条款进行约束，承运人对于该等岸上短途观光或其他服务的履行过程中乘客所遭受的任何损失、延误、不满、损害、人身伤害、死亡或其他任何伤害，不承担任何责任。
			</p>
			<p>6. CANCELLATION, DEVIATION OR SUBSTITUTION BY CARRIER <br> 承运人所作的取消、变更或更换 <br>
			a. Carrier cannot guarantee that the Vessel will call at every port of call or follow every part of the itinerary. Itineraries may change from time to time, both before and after departure. Whilst Carrier always endeavors to avoid changes and cancellations, under certain circumstances, Carrier may find it necessary to cancel, advance, postpone or deviate from any scheduled sailing, port of call, destination, lodging or any activity on or off the Vessel, or substitute another vessel or port of call, destination, lodging or activity. Where possible, Carrier will try to give notice to Passenger or its Travel Representative of any change or cancellation.  Unless otherwise provided in Section 6.d and 6.e, Carrier shall not be liable for any claim whatsoever by Passenger, including but not limited to loss, compensation or refund, by reason of such cancellation, advancement, postponement, substitution or deviation. <br>
			承运人无法保证游轮会在每一个停靠港口停靠或完全按照预定行程进行航行。在起航前或起航后，行程可能会不时发生变更。尽管承运人始终会努力避免对行程进行任何变更或取消，在某些情况下，承运人可能需要将预定的起航时间、停靠港、目的港、客房或其它任何船上或船下活动予以取消、提前、延后或变更，或更换游轮、停靠港、目的港、客房或其它活动项目。可行的情况下，承运人会尽力将变更或取消通知乘客或其旅行代表。除第6.d和第6.e款另有规定外，就上述任何取消、提前、延后、更换或变更行为，承运人均无需对乘客的任何索赔请求负责，包括但不限于损失、赔偿或退款。 <br>
			b. By way of example, and not limitation, Carrier may, deviate from any scheduled sailing and may otherwise land Passenger and her property at any port if Carrier believes that the voyage or any Passenger or property may be hindered or adversely affected as a result of hostilities, blockages, prevailing weather conditions, labor conflicts, strikes onboard or ashore, breakdown of Vessel, congestion, docking difficulties, medical or life saving emergencies or any other cause whatsoever. <br>
			举例而言（不局限于此举例情形），若承运人认为发生了任何不利情形如敌意行为、封锁、不利天气条件、劳资冲突、船上或岸上罢工、船体故障、阻塞、入港困难、医疗或人命救助紧急情况或其它任何原因)从而可能导致航程、任何乘客或财产受到侵害或其它不利影响，则承运人有权改变预定航线和/或将乘客及其财产运至其它任何港口。 <br>
			c. Carrier shall have the right to comply with any orders, recommendations, or directions whatsoever given by any governmental entity or by persons purporting to act with such authority and such compliance shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement entitling the Passenger to assert any claim for liability, compensation or refund. <br>
			对于由任何政府机关（或代表上述政府机关执行公务的人员）所做出的任何命令、建议或指示，承运人均有权予以遵守，且该遵守行为不构成承运人对本协议的违约，乘客也无权因此提出要求承运人承担任何责任、赔偿或退款的索赔请求。 <br>
			d. Cancellation, deviation or substitution may also be caused by a Force Majeure Event. “Force Majeure Event” refers to incidents that cannot be predicted, avoided and overcome, including but not limited to Acts of God, breakdown of the Vessel, hostilities, blockades, labor conflicts, strikes aboard or ashore, restraint of rulers or princes, war, fire, collision, directions of underwriters, arrest, order or restraint by governmental authorities or others, acts of terrorism, civil commotions, weather conditions and considerations of safety of the Vessel (of which the Master shall be the sole judge), foundering of the Vessel or breakdowns of or damage to its hull, machinery and fittings (which Carrier could not have anticipated or avoided despite our normal comprehensive mechanical checks), inability to secure or failure of supplies including fuel, requisition of the Vessel or other circumstances beyond the Carrier’s control (including but not limited to a change in Carrier’s fleet deployment caused by any of the aforementioned events). The followings shall apply in circumstances of cancellation, deviation or substitution by Carrier caused by a Force Majeure Event: <br>
			不可抗力事件也可能导致行程取消、变更或更换。“不可抗力事件”是指无法预见、避免和克服的事件，包括但不限于天灾、游轮故障、敌视行为、封锁、劳资冲突、船上或岸上罢工、政府扣押或管制、战争、火灾、冲突、保险公司指令、逮捕、政府机关或其它主管机关限制或命令、恐怖活动、民众骚乱、天气条件、以及有关游轮安全问题（船长是唯一裁断者）、游轮浸水或船体、机械部件及固定部件的故障或损坏（承运人经惯常及全面的机械检查仍不可预见或避免的情况）、无法保证或未能获取包括燃料在内的供给、游轮被征用、或其它超出承运人控制范围的情况（包括但不限于因任何前述事件导致的承运人运力配置变更）。当不可抗力事件导致承运人做出任何取消、变更或更换时，应适用下述规定：  <br>
			d.1	Pre departure, if Carrier is forced to cancel a cruise completely due to a Force Majeure Event (a change to the itinerary or substitution of ports of call shall not be deemed cancellation of a cruise), the sole liability of Carrier, shall be for refund to Passenger or Travel Representative (when booked through a Travel Representative) the payment received for your booking within thirty (30) days. Passenger booking through a Travel Representative should contact your Travel Representative for refund. <br>
			起航前，如果承运人因不可抗力事件被迫彻底取消游轮行程（行程的变更或停靠港口的更换不应被视为是行程的取消），承运人所需承担的唯一责任是在三十（30）天内，向乘客或其旅行代表（如果乘客是通过旅行代表订票的话）退还承运人所收取的订票费用。通过旅行代表订票的乘客请联系您的旅行代表有关退款事宜。 <br>
			d.2	Pre departure, if itinerary change is required due to a Force Majeure Event and is deemed to have an adverse impact on the overall holiday experience, Passenger will have the following options: (i) accept the changed arrangements, in which case Carrier will, within thirty (30) days, refund to Passenger or its Travel Representative an amount, if any, calculated according to Section 6.d.3 below; or (ii) cancel the cruise, in which case Carrier will, within thirty (30) days, refund to Passenger or its Travel Representative 50% of the Cruise Fare received for your booking, plus port taxes and fees and, when shore excursion is purchased from Carrier, the shore excursion fee refunded to Carrier.  <br>
			起航前，如果因为不可抗力事件需要变更行程且该等变更会对整体度假体验造成不利影响，则乘客应享有以下选择权: (i) 接受变更后的行程安排，该等情况下，承运人将按照下述第6.d.3款在三十（30）天内向乘客或其旅行代表退还费用(如有)；(ii)取消行程，该等情况下，承运人将在三十（30）天内向乘客或其旅行代表退回承运人收取的订票费用的50%，港务税费，以及承运人收到的岸上短途观光费用的退款（如果岸上短途观光是通过承运人购买的话）。 <br>
			d.3	If Passenger chooses the first option mentioned in Section 6.d.2 above and accepts the changed arrangements, the refund, if any, will be made by Carrier to Passenger or its Travel Representative as follows: (i) if Carrier finds it impossible to complete the itinerary and has to shorten a cruise due to a Force Majeure Event, Carrier shall make a prorated refund to Passenger or its Travel Representative of the sum received for such booking for the number of days eliminated from the cruise itinerary.  For purposes of this Section, each Cruise day shall be deemed to commence at 12:01 A.M. (local time).  Any cruise that is canceled after 12:01 P.M. (local time) shall be deemed to be a full day of completed cruise.  The time involved in returning to port of embarkation shall be deemed to be included in the cruise time, provided all services and accommodations are available onboard to Passengers at that time. (ii) if departure is delayed, call at a port is shortened, or returning to destination port is delayed, but the number of days remains the same, Carrier shall not be liable for any refund or compensation, but all services and accommodations will be made available onboard to Passengers. (iii) if port(s) of call is cancelled or substituted and Carrier receives a refund of port taxes and fees and/or shore excursion fee (for shore excursion purchased from Carrier only) due to such cancellation or substitution, Carrier shall refund such amount to Passenger or its Travel Representative.  <br>
			如果乘客选择上述第6.d.2款下规定的第一种方案接受变更后的行程安排，则退款（如有）将按照如下规定由承运人退回给乘客或其旅行代表：(i)如果承运人认为不可抗力事件导致无法完成游轮行程而需要缩减行程天数，则承运人应根据游轮行程中被缩减的巡游天数占总巡游天数的比例，将收取的订票费用按比例退还给乘客或其旅行代表。为本条款之目的，每一巡游日应视为从当地时间上午 12:01开始。若任何巡游在当地时间下午12:01之后取消，应当被视为该日整日的巡游活动已经完成。将游客送返至登船港口途中的时间应被包括在巡游时间内，承运人应向乘客提供游轮上的所有服务和住宿。(ii) 如果起航延误、港口停靠时间缩短或返回目的港延误，但行程天数不减少，则承运人无需承担赔偿或退款的任何责任，而船上将向乘客提供各项服务和住宿。(iii)如果停靠港口被取消或更换且因为该等取消或更换使得承运人收到了港务税费及/或岸上短途观光费用（如果岸上短途观光是通过承运人购买的话）的任何退款，则承运人应将该等退款退回至乘客或其旅行代表。 <br>
			d.4	After commencement of the cruise, if any deviation or substitution is required due to a Force Majeure Event, the sole liability for Carrier is (i) to refund Passenger or its Travel Representative any port taxes and fees and/or shore excursion fee (for shore excursion purchased from Carrier only) which are refunded to Carrier due to such changes, and/or (ii) when cruise is shortened, to refund to Passenger or its Travel Representative, a prorated refund of the sum received for Passenger’s booking for the number of days eliminated from the cruise itinerary. Refund shall be made within thirty (30) days after the end of the cruise.  <br>
			游轮行程开始后，如果因不可抗力事件需要进行任何行程变更或更换，承运人需要承担的唯一责任为: (i)如承运人因该等变更获得任何港务税费及/或岸上短途观光费用（如果岸上短途观光是通过承运人购买的话）的退款，则承运人应将该等退款退回给乘客或其旅行代表；及/或(ii)游轮行程被缩减的情况下，根据游轮行程被缩减的巡游天数所占总行程巡游天数的比例，向乘客或其旅行代表按比例退还收取的订票费用。退款应在游轮行程结束后三十（30）天内进行。 <br>
			e. In the event that a Cruise (or the cruise component of a CruiseTour) is cancelled or terminated early due to mechanical failures: (i) Passenger shall have a right to a full refund of the Cruise Fare if the Cruise is cancelled in full, or a partial refund if the cruise is terminated early; (ii) Carrier may cover or reimburse Passenger for additional costs (e.g. airline change fees) as deemed appropriate by the Carrier; (iii) if Passenger has travelled to the Vessel, Passenger shall have a right to transportation (by means selected by the Carrier) to the Vessel’s scheduled port of disembarkation or the Passenger’s home city; and (iv) Passenger shall have a right to lodging (selected by the Cruise Line) if disembarkation and an overnight stay in an unscheduled port are required due to the Cruise or cruise component of a CruiseTour being cancelled or terminated early because of  such mechanical failures. <br>
			如果因为机械故障导致游轮巡游（或游轮观光中的游轮巡游部分）被取消或提前终止，则(i)若游轮巡游被完全取消，乘客享有巡游巡游费用全额退款的权利；若游轮巡游被提前终止，则享受部分退款；(ii)承运人可在其认为适当的范围内承担或补偿乘客的额外费用（如机票改签费用）；(iii) 若乘客已到达游轮，乘客有权享有交通服务（按照乘客选择的交通方式）将其送至游轮预定的到达港或乘客所属城市；并且(iv)若因游轮巡游或游轮观光中的游轮巡游部分被取消或提前终止导致乘客需要在非预定港口下船并过夜，则乘客有权享有游轮公司选择安排的住宿服务。 <br>
			f. Passenger, on behalf of himself and all other persons traveling under this Ticket Contract (including any accompanying minors or other persons for whom the Ticket Contract was purchased), agrees that should Passenger have any concern, issue or dispute in connection with the itinerary change, such matter should be dealt with in a legal and appropriate way. Under no condition should Passenger engage in demonstrations, protests or other behavior onboard which, in the Carrier’s opinion, is detrimental to the onboard atmosphere, the enjoyment of the cruise by other guests. Passenger should not compel Carrier to assume any liability by way of refusal to embark or disembark the Vessel, behave in any other extreme ways to protest (e.g. sit-ins, gatherings in public areas of the ship, inciting others to protest), interrupt the normal operation or sailing of the Vessel, or otherwise act in violation of the Guest Conduct Policy and laws or regulations of countries that are involved in the cruise. Passengers shall at all times comply with notices from the ship’s Captain and shall in addition comply with the Carrier’s Guest Conduct Policy. Failure to comply with this Section may subject Passenger to actions Carrier may take pursuant to Guest Conduct Policy, and Carrier may also hold Passenger liable for any losses it may suffer therefrom.  <br>
			乘客代表自己及其他所有在本票据合同项下的游客（包括但不限于随行未成年人及其他本合同项下的同行客人）同意，若其对于行程变更有任何疑惑、问题或纠纷，应通过适当且合法的方式解决。在任何情况下，乘客都不得参与船上的示威游行、抗议或其它承运人视为将会对船上气氛、其他乘客的游轮旅游享受造成不利影响的行为。乘客不得通过拒绝登船或离船的方式胁迫承运人承担任何责任，或干扰游轮的运营或航行，或通过极端的方式进行抗议（如静坐抗议、在游轮公共区域聚集、唆使其他游客加入抗议活动等），或采取其它违反乘客行为守则以及游轮航行所涉及的国家的法律法规的行为。乘客应始终遵守游轮船长的通知，并遵守承运人的乘客行为守则。若乘客未能遵守本条款之规定，可能导致承运人根据乘客行为守则采取措施，并要求乘客就其行为可能给承运人造成的损失承担责任。 <br>
			</p>
			<p>7. CANCELLATION OR EARLY DISEMBARKATION BY PASSENGER <br> 乘客所做之取消或提前离船 <br>
			a. If a Passenger books the cruise from a Travel Representative, then your Cruise or Cruisetour Fares, including but not limited to any fuel or other supplemental charges, government taxes and fees and other charges are established by your travel representative that took your booking and not the Carrier.  Similarly, the payment schedule for your Cruise or Cruisetour Fares is established by your travel representative that took your booking and not the Carrier. In addition, all cancellation and refund policies for your Cruise or Cruisetour fares are established by your travel representative that took your booking and not the Carrier.  <br>
			如果乘客是通过旅行代表订票的，则您的游轮巡游或游轮观光费用，包括但不限于任何燃料或其他附加收费、政府税费和其他收费均是为您订票的旅行代表所设定的，而不是承运人。同样，您的游轮或游轮观光费用付款时间表，均是您订票的旅行代表所设定的，而不是承运人。此外，所有针对您的游轮或游轮观光费用的取消和退款政策均是为您订票的旅行代表所设定，而不是承运人。 <br>
			b. Any refund due to Passenger as a result of cancellation by Passenger both prior to or after the Cruise or CruiseTour has begun shall be established and determined by the travel representative that took your booking who shall have sole liability for any refunds, where applicable.  In the event of cancellation by the Passenger pre cruise, or early disembarkation of the Passenger for any reason, including pursuant to any provision of this Ticket Contract, such disembarkation shall be without refund, compensation, or liability on the part of the Carrier whatsoever.   <br>
			游轮巡游或游轮观光开始之前或开始后，任何因乘客取消行程而导致的退款应由为您订票的旅行代表确定和决定，且若需要退款的话，退款的责任应由该旅行代表独立承担。若因任何原因（包括按照本票据合同规定）乘客在游轮巡游开始前取消行程或提前离船，该等情况下承运人不需要退款、赔偿或承担任何责任。 <br>
			c. If a Passenger books the cruise from a Travel Representative, any payments of the Cruise or CruiseTour Fares shall be made to the Travel Representative and not the Carrier.  If Carrier received payment from your travel Representative, the refund will be provided back to that Travel Representative, unless otherwise agreed by Carrier and Travel Representative. <br>
			如果乘客是通过旅行代表订票的，则有关游轮巡游或游轮观光费用的任何款项应当向该旅行代表支付，而不是向承运人支付。如果承运人收到来自您的旅行代表的付款，则除非承运人和旅行代表另有约定，退款将退回至该旅行代表处。 <br>
			d. Passenger acknowledges that for certain voyages, such as a round-trip voyage commencing in a United States port, the Passenger must complete the entire voyage and that failure to do so may result in a fine or other penalty being assessed by one or more governmental agencies.  Passenger hereby agrees to pay any such fine or penalty imposed because Passenger failed to complete the entire voyage and to reimburse Carrier in the event it pays such fine or penalty. <br>
			乘客承认，对某些航行，如从美国港口开始的一个往返航程，乘客必须完成整个的航程，如不这样做可能会导致一个或多个政府机构作出罚款或其他处罚。若乘客未能完成整个航程，乘客在此同意支付任何该等罚款或处罚，若承运人为此支付了罚款或处罚，则乘客应赔偿承运人该等费用。 <br>

Passengers assume full responsibility to determine through their Travel Representative or the appropriate government authority the necessary documents.

			若基于承运人或船长的独立判断，任何乘客或由其负责监护的任何未成年人乘客的行为或活动被认为造成潜在危险、安全风险或对其自身或其他乘客的健康、安全、舒适或愉悦体验产生不利影响、或违反了本协议的任何条款，则承运人有权变更该等乘客的住宿、更改或取消其活动、拒绝提供任何酒精饮料服务、将其限制在舱房或隔离、检查其舱房、财产或行李、变更其陆地游活动、要求其及/或负责监护未成年人的乘客下船或拒绝他们登船、或在任何时候对其进行约束；对此，承运人无需承担任何责任，而乘客须承担该等风险及费用。 <br>
			f. Passenger, or if a minor, his parent or guardian, shall be liable for and indemnify Carrier, the Vessel and the Transport from any civil liability, fines, penalties, costs or expenses incurred by or imposed on the Vessel, the Transport or Carrier arising from or related to Passenger's conduct or failure to comply with any provisions of this Section 8, including but not limited to: (i) any purchases by or credit extended to the Passenger; (ii) requirements relating to immigration, customs or excise (e.g. illegally stays at a port of call and fails to return to the Vessel by the embarkation cut-off time); or (iii) any personal injury, death or damage to persons or property caused directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by any willful or negligent act or omission on the part of the Passenger.   <br>

			g. Carrier shall not be required to refund any portion of the Cruise or CruiseTour Fare paid by any Passenger who fails for any reason to be onboard the Vessel or Transport by the embarkation cut-off time applicable to the specific cruise or cruisetour or the boarding cut-off time applicable at any port of call or destination or point of departure as the case may be, and shall not be responsible for lodging, meals, transportation or other expenses incurred by Passenger as a result thereof.  Boarding cut-off times for  <br>any port of call or destination or point of departure are as announced on the applicable Cruise or Cruise Tour.

			除第6.d及6.e款另有明确规定外，因发生不可抗力事件、战争、恐怖主义、民事骚乱、劳资冲突、政府干涉、海上风险、火灾、盗窃、其它超出承运人合理控制范围的原因或其它任何并非因承运人过失而导致的事件，从而导致任何乘客出现了人身伤害、死亡、疾病、损害、迟延或其它个人或财产的损失、或其它任何索赔损失，承运人均无需承担责任。 <br>
			b. PASSENGER AGREES TO SOLELY ASSUME THE RISK OF INJURY, DEATH, ILLNESS OR OTHER LOSS, AND CARRIER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PASSENGER'S USE OF ANY ATHLETIC OR RECREATIONAL EQUIPMENT; OR FOR THE NEGLIGENCE OR WRONGDOING OF ANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PHOTOGRAPHERS, SPA PERSONNEL OR ENTERTAINERS; OR FOR EVENTS TAKING PLACE OFF THE CARRIER'S VESSELS, LAUNCHES OR TRANSPORTS, OR AS PART OF ANY SHORE EXCURSION, TOUR OR ACTIVITY. <br>
			乘客同意：对于因乘客使用任何健身或娱乐设备或因任何独立合同方（包括但不限于摄影师、SPA工作人员或其它演艺人员）的过失或过错行为而产生的人身伤害、死亡、疾病或其它损失，或因承运人的游轮、航行或运输行为之外的其它原因，或因任何岸上短途观光、陆地游或其它活动而产生的人身伤害、死亡、疾病或其它损失，均应由乘客自行承担风险，且承运人均无需对上述人身伤害、死亡、疾病或其它损失负责。 <br>
			c. CARRIER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY TO THE PASSENGER FOR DAMAGES FOR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, MENTAL SUFFERING OR PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WHEN SUCH DAMAGES WERE NEITHER THE RESULT OF A PHYSICAL INJURY TO THE PASSENGER, NOR THE RESULT OF PASSENGER HAVING BEEN AT ACTUAL RISK OF PHYSICAL INJURY, NOR WERE INTENTIONALLY INFLICTED BY THE CARRIER.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, IN NO EVENT WILL CARRIER BE LIABLE TO PASSENGER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. <br>
			在任何情况下，对于乘客所遭受的任何种类的精神损害、精神痛苦或心理伤害，若其并非由于对乘客的身体伤害所致，或并非由于乘客曾经处于可能发生身体伤害的实际风险中所致，或其并非是由承运人故意行为所致，则承运人均不向乘客承担任何责任。在不限制上述规定的前提下，在任何情形下，承运人均无需承担任何间接、附带、惩罚性及惩戒性的损害赔偿责任。 <br>
			d. ON CRUISES WHICH NEITHER EMBARK, DISEMBARK NOR CALL AT ANY PORT IN THE UNITED STATES, CARRIER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ANY AND ALL LIABILITY LIMITATIONS, IMMUNITIES AND RIGHTS APPLICABLE TO IT UNDER THE “ATHENS CONVENTION RELATING TO THE CARRIAGE OF PASSENGERS AND THEIR LUGGAGE BY SEA” OF 1974, AS WELL AS THE “PROTOCOL TO THE ATHENS CONVENTION RELATING TO THE CARRIAGE OF PASSENGERS AND THEIR LUGGAGE BY SEA” OF 1976 (“ATHENS CONVENTION”). THE ATHENS CONVENTION LIMITS THE CARRIER'S LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO A PASSENGER TO NO MORE THAN 46,666 SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS AS DEFINED THEREIN (APPROXIMATELY U.S. $70,000, WHICH AMOUNT FLUCTUATES, DEPENDING ON DAILY EXCHANGE RATE AS PRINTED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL).  IN ADDITION, AND ON ALL OTHER CRUISES, ALL THE EXEMPTIONS FROM AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY PROVIDED IN OR AUTHORIZED BY THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES (INCLUDING TITLE 46, UNITED STATES CODE SECTIONS 30501 THROUGH 30509 AND 30511) WILL APPLY. <br>
			对于不在美国任何港口登船、离船或停靠的游轮巡游而言，承运人均有权根据《1974年海上旅客及其行李运输雅典公约》及《1974年海上旅客及其行李运输雅典公约的1976年议定书》（以下合称“雅典公约”）之规定，享有所有责任限制、责任豁免及其它相关权利。根据雅典公约之规定，承运人就人身伤害或死亡所承担的最大责任限额为46,666个特别提款权赔偿（按照公约之定义，大约为$70,000美元，该金额随华尔街日报登印的每日汇率而波动）。此外，美国法律（包括美国法典第46章第30501条至第30509条以及第30511条）规定或授予的所有责任限制或责任豁免也应适用，且这一规定同样适用于任何其他游轮巡游。 <br>

			f. Carrier shall have the right to deny boarding for violations of any of the policies set forth in this Section. If Carrier exercises its rights under this Section 12, Passenger shall have no claim against Carrier whatsoever and Carrier shall have no liability for refund, compensation loss or damages of Passenger, including but not limited to any expenses incurred by Passenger for Accommodation or repatriation. <br>

			</p>
			<p>13. ALCOHOL POLICY <br>饮酒规定<br>
			Fleet Wide Policy: The minimum drinking age for all alcoholic beverages on Royal Caribbean International ships depends on the location of the ship at the start of the cruise itinerary.

For ships originating in North America, the minimum drinking age is twenty-one (21).

			If a guest that is below the minimum age limit to consume alcohol onboard has a birthday during a cruise itinerary that would then mean they meet the minimum age limit for consuming alcohol onboard, they must notify the Guest Relations Desk and provide evidence in the form of their passport as proof of age in order to allow the Guest Relations Desk to update their details and permit them to purchase alcohol onboard. <br>
			如果低于最小饮酒年龄的客人在航程中度过生日并达到最小饮酒年龄，客人必须通知客户关系服务台，并且提供护照作为证明年纪的证据，以使客户关系服务台的工作人员更新他们的信息并允许他们在船上购买酒精饮料。 <br>
